# Network Policy Violation Detector

A passive network monitoring and detection framework that inspects live traffic and identifies violations of defined security policies. This project leverages packet-level inspection to detect insecure protocols, cleartext authentication, and unexpected internal communication patterns in segmented networks.

The tool is designed as a **defensive visibility and detection system**, emphasizing explainable alerts and policy-driven analysis rather than raw packet capture.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is a **research and learning framework**, not a production intrusion detection system.
> It is intended to demonstrate detection logic, protocol risk analysis, and SOC-style alerting concepts in a controlled lab environment.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- **`src/`**  
  Core detection engine and packet processing logic. Modules handle packet capture, protocol parsing, and policy evaluation.

- **`policies/`**  
  Configuration files defining allowed and disallowed protocols, authentication rules, and network behavior expectations.

- **`docs/`**  
  Detailed documentation covering detection logic, supported policy rules, and analysis methodology for each detection category.

- **`logs/`**  
  Structured alert and event logs generated by the detector, suitable for ingestion into SIEM platforms or further analysis.

- **`tests/`**  
  Controlled traffic generation and validation scripts used to verify detection accuracy.  
  These scripts simulate insecure or policy-violating behavior for testing purposes only.

## Detection Capabilities

### Disallowed Protocol Detection  
Identifies traffic using insecure or deprecated protocols such as FTP, Telnet, or other cleartext services that violate defined network policy.

### Cleartext Authentication Detection  
Inspects packet payloads to detect authentication credentials transmitted without encryption, including HTTP Basic Authentication and legacy login mechanisms.

### Internal Policy Violation Monitoring  
Flags unexpected peer-to-peer or east–west communication patterns that deviate from established network baselines.

### Legacy Service Identification  
Detects services commonly disabled in hardened environments, such as NetBIOS, LLMNR, or SMBv1, to highlight unnecessary attack surface.

Each detection generates a structured event describing:
- Source and destination context
- Protocol and service involved
- Policy rule violated
- Severity and justification

## Getting Started

Run the detection engine from the `src/` directory with the appropriate policy file loaded from `policies/`.

Refer to the documentation in `docs/` for:
- Supported policy rules
- Detection logic explanations
- Example alert outputs
- Lab validation scenarios
