## Overview

SentinelNet is a passive network detection framework designed to identify insecure protocols, cleartext authentication, and legacy communication patterns that violate defined security policies in enterprise-style networks.

The tool emphasizes **defensive visibility**, **policy-driven analysis**, and **explainable alerts**, modeling how SOC teams reason about network risk rather than focusing on raw packet capture or active enforcement.

SentinelNet is intended as a **research and learning framework** for understanding network security monitoring, protocol risk analysis, and detection engineering concepts in controlled lab environments.




## 📁 Repository Structure

- **`src/`**  
  Core detection engine and packet processing logic. Modules handle packet capture, protocol parsing, and policy evaluation.

- **`policies/`**  
  Configuration files defining allowed and disallowed protocols, authentication rules, and network behavior expectations.

- **`docs/`**  
  Detailed documentation covering detection logic, supported policy rules, and analysis methodology for each detection category.

- **`logs/`**  
  Structured alert and event logs generated by the detector (`.jsonl`, `.log`), suitable for ingestion into SIEM platforms or further analysis. 

- **`tests/`**  
  Controlled packet construction and validation tests used to verify detection accuracy. These tests simulate policy-violating traffic patterns for validation purposes only.

## Detection Capabilities

### Disallowed Protocol Detection  
Identifies traffic using insecure or deprecated protocols such as FTP, Telnet, or other cleartext services that violate defined network policy.

### Cleartext Authentication Detection  
Inspects packet payloads to detect authentication credentials transmitted without encryption, including HTTP Basic Authentication and legacy login mechanisms.

### Internal Policy Violation Monitoring  
Flags traffic that violates explicitly defined policy rules, such as the use of disallowed ports or legacy name resolution services within internal networks.

### Legacy Service Identification  
Detects services commonly disabled in hardened environments, such as NetBIOS, LLMNR, or SMBv1, to highlight unnecessary attack surface.

Each detection generates a structured event describing:
- Source and destination context
- Protocol and service involved
- Policy rule violated
- Severity and justification

---

## Getting Started

Run the detection engine from the `src/` directory with the appropriate policy file loaded from `policies/`.

Refer to the documentation in `docs/` for:
- Supported policy rules
- Detection logic explanations
- Example alert outputs
- Lab validation scenarios
